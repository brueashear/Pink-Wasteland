- Readme
at the moment this is a widescreen only skin, it WILL NOT work on anything lower than 1280x720

You can find extra elements for customization purposes in the folders at the top of the skin
folder. Please check there for extra cursors, turning off the "playfield border," and maybe
more things that I've added later on.

This skin is unfinished and some elements have yet to be changed from what they were before.
Sound effects will most likely remain unchanged so all those belong to their respective owners.
All skin elements that HAVE been replaced belong to me and are available for use in personal
skins. That means no sharing it on the forums while my content is in there. Share it on
your profile all you want but it's against the rules to post it on the forums. Just a friendly
heads up.

The font used in most skin elements is "Wasteland" by Anton Bohlin, you can find it here
(https://www.behance.net/gallery/14334393/Wasteland-Free-Font) in .AI format. It's loadable
in to Photoshop where you can just copy + paste the letters you need. It's not an actual typeface.
